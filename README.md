# Machine Learning - Group Classification Assignment

## Introduction
This project undertakes the analysis of classification algorithms using a dataset derived from vehicle sensors. The dataset includes features for classifying three distinct labels: Driving Style, Road Surface Condition, and Traffic Congestion. A data cleaning process is performed, addressing formatting inconsistencies and missing values while also looking at imbalanced datasets, feature scaling, changing classes to numeric values, and determining what features are useful. The study focuses on the classification of Road Surface Conditions. Two classification models, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are trained and evaluated. This research provides insights into the performance of classification algorithms on real-world sensor data, specifically in the context of road surface classification.
